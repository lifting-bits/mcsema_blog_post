# Lifting and Diversifying C++ Binaries

This repository accompanies the Trail of Bits blog post discussing how to use mcsema with Immunant's multicompiler to lift and diversify binaries.

# The Example Program

The sample program uses stack variables, global variables, and C++ exceptions to showcase features of both McSema and the multicompiler.

# Prerequisites

Please install Immunant's multicompiler as described in their blog post.
